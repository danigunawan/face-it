# Face It!

Powered by **Clarifai API**, **[Face It!](https://face-it-app.firebaseapp.com)** is an AI-based app that helps detect human faces, if any, in digital images.

## Description

Created with **React.js** and hosted on **Google's Firebase**, this web app identifies and locates human faces in images through the implementation of the **[Clarifai API](https://www.clarifai.com)**. The user has the option to either _sign in anonymously_ or _create an account with email and password_ in order to get access to the actual app where they can have their image link processed by the API. These sign-in/sign-up methods and user data are handled by **Firebase Authentication** and **Database** services.
